        <h2> Text Box 1</h2>
        <p>This is the text in box one. It should appear in the upper left side
        of the website. There should be an image to the right and below this box.
        The background color for this box should be a light grey. I might make the
        the text color white if the background is too dark, but it probably won't
        look good any way I do it. This should be enough text to fill the space of the box.

      <div class="text">
        <h2>Text Box 2</h2>
        <p>This is the text in text box two. There should be a picture on the top,
        bottom, and left of this text. I should make sure to add spacing somehow
        so that the text is in the center of the cell. I hope that it is automatic
        but I think I read that you can set it in the css, so I might have to try that.
        I'm also going to make sure the background color matches the other text boxes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Text Box 3</h2>
        <p>This is the text on the third row. It should be on the first column.
        There should be an image on the top and right of this text box. Below this box,
        there will be another grid in the footer. This one will be set up to go
        horizontally automatically. I need to go back in the text and see how to do it.
        I'm not sure how or if I want to show the borders for these elements. I could
        do it with empty b elements with a background color, but that seems like a lot
        of work. Hopefully putting borders on these elements will be enough. Or I will
        leave it out entirely.
