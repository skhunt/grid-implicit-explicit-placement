        <h2>Destiny, as dawn.</h2>
        <p>
          They say the brightest lights cast the darkest shadows, and loves,
          there is nothing brighter than you. The little knight knows this best,
          having paved his way in blood and devotion alike, clawing his way out
          of the night with his head craned to watch the sunrise, dawn warming
          his cheeks until at last it breaks into a new day.

        <h2>Destiny, as sunshine.</h2>
        <p>
          They say the brightest lights cast the darkest shadows, and loves,
          there is nothing brighter than you. The king runs, always chasing,
          always calling, his heart beating in sync with the breath of two names
          that leap from his tongue again, again, again â€” until at long last, he
          crumples, a monarch on his knees in the shadow of his beloveds, joy
          singing in his veins (tears rolling down his cheeks) as his hands
          clasp around theirs.

        <h2>Destiny, as radiance.</h2>
        <p>
          They say the brightest lights cast the darkest shadows, and loves,
          there is nothing brighter than you. And the brilliant warrior, her chin
          high, hopes even higher, but oh what cruelties fate has in store for
          her, she who blazes with all the power of a star gone supernova, who
          bares her teeth to the world that tries to push her down and tell her,
          <em>be soft, this is not your battle,</em> but it is she who bleeds
          for them, so isn't it her battle after all?
