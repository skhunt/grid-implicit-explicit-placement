        I know you didn't ask, but dusk closes in with its shadowy wings to
        chase out all the color of the day, sweeping in with a star-studded
        quilt of heavy night. The red dies every day and every night, either
        smothered by the moon or drowned out in the sun. This is one way to
        immortalize it, to learn everything about it, to know it even when it's
        gone. Got it memorized? (Meet me in the center, says the unjust man.)
